Spies and Sons Inc. is back again with their latest program for super secret spy communications. 

This program takes in a message and shifts each letter of the message by the number of alphabets specified by the shift number. This can be used to either encode the message by shifting each letter forward or decode the message by shifting each letter backwards.

If the user is satisfied with their message, they can exit the program or try again if they want to use a different shift number or message.
