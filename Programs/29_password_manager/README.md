# Password Manager

Have you ever been on a website and thought, wait what password did I use to sign up for this again?

If you have read one too many cyber-attack articles and lost your faith in internet security like me, then this password manager is for you. While the security aspect of storing passwords in plain text files on your local machine is still questionable, at least the 'not-remembering-a-million-passwords' problem is for sure taken care of using this. 

Disclaimer: I 100% DO NOT recommend using this program to actually save passwords in this format.

# How it works
The UI has the logo and text boxes to type in the website name, the sign-up email or username, and the password. Additionally, the user can also generate a password if they are signing up for a new website and need a new password. Once they have entered all the values, they can press the 'Add' option to add values to a text file. Upon clicking the add button, a pop-up is displayed asking the user to check the entered values, if the user selects 'Ok' details are added, and a new pop-up shows a confirmation. If the user leaves any detail blank, an error pop-up shows to notify the user of missing entries. 

The password generation is done through a password generator program previously made on Day 5.

- The add entry function gets the values in the text boxes, checks if any values are blank and if not gets the confirmation from the user. If the user confirms, the text file is opened, the values are written into the file and deleted from the text boxes in the program. The final confirmation if displayed as a pop-up.
