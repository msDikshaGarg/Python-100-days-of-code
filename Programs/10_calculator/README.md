This is a basic 4 function calculator. The included functions are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

The calculator takes the first number, next it takes the input for the function to perform. Third, it takes the second number, performs the function and displayes the output.

Next, the program asks the user if they want to continue with their calculation. If the user selects yes, the program takes the current output as the first number and asks the user for operation and second number, performs the function and displays the output. The recursive function is run till the user wants to stop calculating. When the user stops calculating, the program refreshes and prompts for a new fresh calculation.
