# Higher or Lower

![HighOrLow](../../GIFs/giphy_mathing.gif)

This is a Higher or Lower game inspired by the real [The Higher Lower Game](https://www.higherlowergame.com/).

The game selects a random account from the instagram follower count data dictionary, then it selects another account and asks the player to guess who has a higher follower count. If the player guesses correctly, the player gains a point and the game continues on. The second account is now compared to a third account and so on. 

When the player guesses incorrectly, the game stops and the final score is displayed. The player is then given the option to play again.
